# Social Media Insights for Presidential Impact Prediction
This project delves into the realm of sentiment analysis, employing a lexicon-based approach to
discern public opinion on the United States presidential election and its aftermath. With the
upcoming elections looming, the study aims to compare sentiments surrounding the incumbent
president, Joe Biden, before and after the elections. The significance of such an analysis lies in
its potential to offer insights into the president's performance and gauge public perception of his
contributions. Leveraging Twitter as a primary data source due to its widespread use in political
discourse, the study utilizes data sets collected from Twitter, sourced from Data World Twitter
datasets.
